# About

Mod that adds a few more deposit blockers and their respective technologis, purely to increase variety.

# Compatibility

The mod is **OS-agnostic**, which means that it will work on all of the operating systems supported by the game.

It is actively tested (and developed) on **Linux**, where it is guaranteed to work with either the native version of the game or through Steam Play.

It should also be compatible with any other mods.
